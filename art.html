                <h2>Project 1: Dúlachán</h2>
                <p>This art piece was a concept art made surrounding the Irish mythological being 
                    known as a Dúlachán. They were the original inspiration for the Headless Horseman 
                    and I wanted to create a piece for it. The inspiration for the piece was a photograph 
                    I took while I was living in Scotland.

                <p>This is an art piece of a character I made for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Much of my art 
                    is inspired by the characters that I and my friends create for our campaigns. They are an Eladrin  
                    Four Elements Monk inspired by Chinese mythology and constellations of the Four Guardians.

                    Totem Warrior Barbarian inspired by a joke about being a bear barbarian. I love making funny 
                    little bits for my characters.

                <p>This is an art piece of a character I made for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. This is the entire

                    and a Kobold Rogue. This was the piece that I made for the group to celebrate the end of our campaign.
