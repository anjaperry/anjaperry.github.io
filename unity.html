        <h2>Project 1: Superposition Comic</h2>
        <p>This was a group project to make an interactive comic about superposition.
            I was responsible for the background art and some of the game mechanics.

        <h2>Project 2: Fish and Game: Hunter's Safety</h2>
        <p>This is a Hunters Safety VR Simulation made in collaboration with the Fish and Game department 
            in order to help new hunters learn the basics of hunting safety while they're in their courses. 
            I was responsible for some game mechanics and template work for the project.
